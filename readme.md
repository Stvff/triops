# Triops
This is (yet another) language I'm working on, with some new and fun ideas.\
It's not quite done, but the main idea is that this language is more of an assembly macro, with the capability to reach very high above assembly.

We'll see how it goes.

You can read [the first guide](https://github.com/Stvff/triops/blob/master/docs/compiler_internals.md) and some compiler development logs in the docs folder,
and read some unorganized triops code in lang, and any `.trs` file.

It's regrettably written in Go, because I wanted experience with it, but as soon as I've got it working, I'm going to begin selfhosting it,
because I've come to learn I don't really like Go as much as I thought I would.
