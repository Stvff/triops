Unexpected toplevel token:
3 | for;
    ^^^
Name must not be a number, string or language keyword:
17 | type;
         ^
The word `is` was expected:
19 | type type_error;
                    ^
Type declarations expect the alignment and column size to be positive integers:
21 | type type_error is;
                       ^
Enum does not exist:
24 | type type_error is undefined;
                        ^^^^^^^^^
Value or type was not defined:
24 | type type_error is undefined;
                        ^^^^^^^^^
Alignment can only be a power of two, up to 16:
27 | type type_error is 6 bytes;
                          ^^^^^
Expected either the keyword `bytes` or `columns`:
29 | type type_error is 4;
                         ^
Expected the keyword `bytes`:
31 | type type_error is 3 columns of 4;
                                      ^
Expected a semicolon or typeform:
33 | type type_error is 3 columns of 4 bytes intform;
                                             ^^^^^^^
Given type does not exist:
44 | enum;
         ^
Name must not be a number, string or language keyword:
46 | enum t1;
            ^
Enum must have a block of names (and optional values) or be a single assignment:
48 | enum t1 enum_error;
                       ^
Invalid integer:
50 | enum t1 enum_error1 = ;
                           ^
Names must not be reserved keywords or values:
52 | enum t1 enum_error2 {for};
                          ^^^
Name is already in use in this enum:
54 | enum t1 enum_error3 {a, a};
                             ^
Invalid integer:
56 | enum t1 enum_error4 {a = };
                              ^
Expected a comma or closing brace:
58 | enum t1 enum_error5 {a = 12 b};
                                 ^
Unknown type for global declaration:
74 | type_error;
     ^^^^^^^^^^
Value for array size needs to be a positive integer:
76 | t1['] decl_error;
        ^
Array size bracket not closed:
78 | t1[3 decl_error;
          ^^^^^^^^^^
This enum is not a single constant, a subname needs to be specified:
80 | t1 decl_error = e2;
                       ^
Invalid enum subname:
82 | t1 decl_error = e2.;
                        ^
Enum subvalue does not exist:
84 | t1 decl_error = e2.d;
                        ^
Type mismatch between declared variable and enum value:
86 | t2 decl_error = e1;
                     ^^
This variable/constant does not allow string assignment:
88 | t5[] decl_error = "abcd";
                       ^^^^^^
Given string was larger than the size of the array:
90 | byte[3] decl_error = "abcd";
                          ^^^^^^
Value in array is malformed:
92 | byte[4] decl_error = 10;
                            ^
Value in array is malformed:
93 | byte[4] decl_error = {10,,};
                              ^
Unexpected token in array literal:
95 | byte[4] decl_error = {10 word};
                              ^^^^
Too many values in static array literal (expected 4 values, got 5):
97 | byte[4] decl_error = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                                        ^
Too few values in static array literal (expected 4 values, got 3):
99 | byte[4] decl_error = {1, 2, 3};
                                  ^
Expected a valid variable to bind a register to:
111 | #reg undefined;
           ^^^^^^^^^
Total size of the variable to be bound must be less than 8 bytes (was 16):
113 | #reg v5;
           ^^
Expected an `=`:
115 | #reg v1;
             ^
Missing closing bracket:
117 | add v1[0, v2;
              ^
A label has an alignment of 8, which is not the same as the alignment used in this instruction (4 bytes):
119 | add v1, #lbl l1;
                   ^^
This register does not have the alignment expected in its context, It has 4 bytes, while 8 bytes was expected:
121 | add #rq rax, #rd eax;
                   ^^^
Register must not be a keyword or value:
123 | add #rq 1;
              ^
The maximum amount of arguments for assembly instructions is 3:
125 | add v1, v2, v2, v1;
                    ^
This variable does not have the alignment expected in its context. It is aligned to 8 bytes, while 4 bytes was expected:
127 | add v1, ptr;
              ^^^
Enum value does not have the alignment expected in its context. It is aligned to 4 bytes, while 1 bytes was expected:
129 | add v6, e1;
              ^^
Enum or variable was not defined:
131 | add v1, undefined;
              ^^^^^^^^^
Enum subvalue does not exist:
133 | add v1, e2.d;
                 ^
Keyword, enum, variable or value was not defined or recognized:
135 | add .;
          ^
Usage of a label that doesn't exist:
137 | jmp #lbl undefined;
               ^^^^^^^^^
Amount of errors: 45
